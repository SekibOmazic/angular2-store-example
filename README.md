# WIP: @ngrx/store Best Practices

 - [Normalizr](https://github.com/gaearon/normalizr) & [ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)
 - ["Smart" & "Dumb" Components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.d2pgf7r58)
 - [<code>AsyncPipe</code>](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/pipes.html#!#the-stateful-asyncpipe-) to handle subscription to Observables
 - Store is never exposed and only used privately inside services to dispatch Actions
 - Splice up the store using RxJS Operators (i.e. <code>Users.users$</code>, <code>Users.loading$</code>, <code>Users.adding$</code>) for easier consumption in Smart Components

### Quick start

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:meenie/angular2-store-example.git

# change directory to our repo
cd angular2-store-example

# install the repo with npm
npm install

# install TypeScript typings
./node_modules/.bin/typings install

# start the server
npm start
```
go to [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000) in your browser

## File Structure
We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:
```
angular2-webpack-starter/
 ├──src/                       * our source files that will be compiled to javascript
 |   ├──main.ts                * our entry file for our browser environment
 │   │
 |   ├──index.html             * Index.html: where we generate our index page
 │   │
 |   ├──vendor.ts              * our vendor file
 │   │
 │   ├──app/                   * WebApp: folder
 │   │   ├──app.spec.ts        * a simple test of components in app.ts
 │   │   └──app.ts             * App.ts: a simple version of our App component components
 │   │
 │   └──assets/                * static assets are served here
 │       ├──icon/              * our list of icons from www.favicon-generator.org
 │       ├──service-worker.js  * ignore this. Web App service worker that's not complete yet
 │       ├──robots.txt         * for search engines to crawl your website
 │       └──human.txt          * for humans to know who the developers are
 │
 ├──test/                      * this is our global unit tests and end-to-end tests
 │
 ├──spec-bundle.js             * ignore this magic that sets up our angular 2 testing environment
 ├──karma.config.js            * karma config for our unit tests

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v4.1.x`+ and NPM `2.14.x`+

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:
* `webpack` (`npm install --global webpack`)
* `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install --global webpack-dev-server`)
* `karma` (`npm install --global karma-cli`)
* `protractor` (`npm install --global protractor`)
* `typings` (`npm install --global typings`)
* `typescript` (`npm install --global typescript`)

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies
* `typings install` to install necessary typings
* `npm run server` to start the dev server in another tab

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run server` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:3000/`).

### server
```bash
# development
npm run server
# production
npm run build:prod
npm run server:prod
```

## Other commands

### build files
```bash
# development
npm run build:dev
# production
npm run build:prod
```

### watch and build files
```bash
npm run watch
```

### run tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### run webdriver (for end-to-end)
```bash
npm run webdriver:update
npm run webdriver:start
```

### run end-to-end tests
```bash
# make sure you have webdriver running and a sever for the client app
npm run e2e
```

Please do :).

# TypeScript
> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to install it globally and use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

## Use latest TypeScript compiler
TypeScript 1.7.x includes everything you need. Make sure to upgrade, even if you installed TypeScript previously.

```
npm install --global typescript
```

## Use a TypeScript-aware editor
We have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 10](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)

# Frequently asked questions
* What's the current browser support for Angular 2 Beta?
  * Please view the updated list of [browser support for Angular 2](https://github.com/angularclass/awesome-angular2#current-browser-support-for-angular-2)
* Why is my service, aka provider, is not injecting parameter correctly?
  * Please use `@Injectable()` for your service for typescript to correctly attach the metadata (this is a TypeScript problem)
* How do I run protractor with node 0.12.x?
  * please check out this repo to use the old version of protractor [#146](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/pull/146/files)
* Where do I write my tests?
  * You can write your tests next do your component files see [`/src/app/home/home.spec.ts`](/src/app/home/home.spec.ts)
* How do I start the app when I get `EACCES` and `EADDRINUSE` errors?
  * The `EADDRINUSE` error means the port `3000` is currently being used and `EACCES` is lack of permission for webpack to build files to `./dist/`
* How to use `sass` for css?
 * `loaders: ['raw-loader','sass-loader']` and `@Component({ styles: [ require('./filename.scss') ] })` see issue [#136](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/136)
* How do I test a Service?
 * See issue [#130](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/130#issuecomment-158872648)
* How fo I add `vscode-chrome-debug` support?
 * The VS Code chrome debug extension support can be done via `launch.json` see issue [#144](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/144#issuecomment-164063790)
